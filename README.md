Pyber Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:


Results: The Pyber ride summary data confirms our assumptions. Based off city type. Urban areas has 3x as many rides than Suburban areas, Suburban areas have 4x as many riders as rural areas. The data also confirms that drivers are more numerously condensed in Urban areas. Due to urban areas having more people drivers in urban areas, make more money this is reflected in the total fare in correlation to the total rides. 

However on drivers on Average in Rural areas earn a higher rate ride. almost 3x higher the urban rides. Possible because rural rides need to travel for much longer distances than urban rides. We can see a inverse relationship between the average fares and total rides. Rural areas earn $5 

Summary:
City Type Performance: 
Best) Urban
Middle) Suburban
Worst) Rural

Best Performing Months: 
For the Time range of Jan 2019 - May 2019. All 3 city types had the same bullish pattern. This should be explored deeper and we should find out the cause.

Urban Profitablilty: 
Urban forms a double top, between middle of Feburary and middle of March. The second spike in March is unique and does not occur in suburban and Rural. This outlier should be explored more, because Urban is our most profitable City type.
